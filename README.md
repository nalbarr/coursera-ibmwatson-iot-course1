### My Learning Objectives
- Assess IBM Cloud (formerly IBM Bluemix) and IoT capabiliteis
- Experiment with and build out a Raspberry Pi
- Understanding what development models Raspberry Pi supports
- Mentor and expose NLA on some basic programming (e.g., Javascript, Python)

### Key Takeaways
- IBM Node-RED is a very lighweight flow editor and effective for quick and low complexity prototyping
- IBM Watson APIs are not too hard to learn, however still challenging to know which services to use for what purposes
- IBM Cloud is very close to Cloud Foundry look and feel for development
- Raspberry Pi comes with very capable variant of UNIX and as well comes with standard SDKs baked in
- SenseHat hardware is very capable (e.g., record temperature)
